## 🚀 What is Afterlib?

Afterlib is an advanced eCommerce ad intelligence and product research platform built by a dedicated team of digital marketing experts and used by over 80,000 marketers, dropshippers, and eCommerce entrepreneurs worldwide. Founded by Michael — a founder known across the Afterlib community for being personally available via live chat almost around the clock — the platform was built with a single purpose: give eCommerce sellers the clearest, most accurate, and most actionable intelligence on what is actually selling, what ads are actually working, and what competitors are actually doing, without the guesswork, saturated data, or inaccurate trend signals that plague most ad spy tools on the market.

What separates Afterlib from every competing ad intelligence tool is the combination of database size, data accuracy, and filter depth. The platform provides access to over 200,000 new advertisements every single day across Facebook, Instagram, Google, YouTube, Pinterest, and Quora — the broadest multi-platform ad library available at any price point in the eCommerce research space. Alongside the ad library, Afterlib includes a silent store revenue tracker that estimates the earnings of Shopify competitors without alerting them, a custom meta page list system pioneered by the Afterlib team that allows competitive research at a depth no other tool offers, and a product research engine with a filter range so extensive that experienced users report identifying winning products within minutes rather than hours. Plans start from $36.75 per month after discounts, with a Basic plan covering 10,000 credits and 30-store revenue tracking, a Pro plan for unlimited credits across 65 stores, and a Team plan for collaborative workflows across 125 stores and five devices simultaneously — all backed by a 5-star Trustpilot rating from 80 verified reviews and a support team that traders and marketers consistently describe as the fastest, most human, and most genuinely helpful in the industry.

## 💼 Why Choose Afterlib Over Other Ad Spy Tools?

Afterlib has built a reputation as one of the most data-accurate, feature-rich, and genuinely useful eCommerce intelligence platforms available in 2026. Here is what sets it apart:

- **200,000+ new ads added every single day across six major platforms** — the Afterlib ad library updates daily with over 200,000 new advertisements sourced from Facebook, Instagram, Google, YouTube, Pinterest, and Quora, giving users a real-time view of what is performing across every major advertising channel rather than a static database that reflects last month's trends rather than this week's winning products
- **Real-time data — no saturated or recycled winning products** — unlike tools that surface the same high-competition products that thousands of other sellers have already found and launched, Afterlib's real-time data pipeline identifies emerging winners before they reach mass saturation, giving users a genuine first-mover advantage over competitors still relying on slower or less frequently updated intelligence tools
- **Silent store revenue tracker across Shopify competitors** — the Afterlib store revenue tracker estimates the earnings of competing Shopify stores in real time without triggering any notification to the store owner, giving sellers competitive financial intelligence on exactly how much revenue rival stores are generating, which products are driving it, and how those figures change week to week as market conditions shift
- **Extensive filter system — find winners in minutes, not hours** — the Afterlib filter library is one of the most extensive in the ad spy space, allowing users to sort and filter ads by platform, performance metrics, trend trajectory, ad format, targeting signals, and dozens of additional parameters; experienced users consistently report that the filter depth is so granular that identifying actionable winning products takes minutes rather than the hours required on tools with simpler or less configurable search systems
- **Custom meta page lists — a unique innovation with no equivalent** — the custom meta page list system, pioneered by the Afterlib team and available nowhere else in the ad intelligence industry, allows users to go beyond individual ad and product research to conduct deep competitive analysis of entire competitor stores, ad portfolios, and market segments in a structured, revisitable format that compounds research value over time
- **Facebook Ads Library integration with advanced filtering** — Afterlib extends and enhances the native Facebook Ads Library with custom filtering, trend analysis, and performance metrics that the native tool does not provide, giving advertisers a dramatically more powerful view of competitor Facebook ad strategies than is accessible through Meta's own interface
- **Multi-platform ad spy including Google, YouTube, Pinterest, and Quora** — while most ad spy tools focus exclusively or primarily on Facebook and Instagram, Afterlib covers the full range of major advertising platforms in a single subscription, giving users comprehensive competitive intelligence across every channel where eCommerce ads run rather than requiring separate tools for each platform
- **User-friendly interface with clean UX and intuitive navigation** — multiple Trustpilot reviewers specifically highlight the clarity and cleanliness of Afterlib's interface as a differentiating feature; the platform makes a genuinely large and complex ad database navigable for users at every experience level without the cluttered, confusing dashboards that characterise many competing intelligence tools
- **Bookmarking and collection system for ongoing research organisation** — users can bookmark favourite ads and products into named collections for future reference, building a structured and revisitable research library rather than starting fresh every session; this system is particularly valued by teams running ongoing competitive monitoring across multiple product categories or markets simultaneously
- **Flexible subscription with self-service cancellation** — Afterlib operates a straightforward monthly subscription model with no lock-in contracts and self-service cancellation available at any time through the user dashboard, giving subscribers full control over their subscription without needing to contact support or navigate cancellation workflows designed to retain users against their will
- **Human-first support available almost 24/7** — Afterlib's support model is built around direct human engagement rather than AI-bot deflection; Michael the founder and the broader support team are consistently available via live chat to provide personalised guidance, resolve issues in real time, and actively incorporate user feedback into the platform's ongoing development — a level of founder and team accessibility that reviewers across Trustpilot describe as rare in any software category
- **5-star Trustpilot rating from 80 verified reviews** — Afterlib's Trustpilot profile reflects consistent praise for data accuracy, product research effectiveness, filter depth, and above all the quality and speed of human support — with individual reviewers citing eight-figure eCommerce results achieved using products found through the platform, and multiple users describing Afterlib as years ahead of the second best tool they have tried

## 🔓 Reduce Your Subscription Cost with SAVE30

Afterlib plans are already priced competitively for the level of intelligence, data freshness, and platform coverage they deliver — starting from $36.75 per month after existing discounts for the Basic plan, $99 per month for the Pro plan with unlimited credits and 65-store revenue tracking, and $299 per month for the Team plan covering five devices and 125-store monitoring. With the discount code **SAVE30**, you reduce that already accessible subscription cost by a further 30% across all three tiers, making it the most affordable entry to real-time multi-platform ad intelligence, a 200,000-daily-ad database, a silent Shopify store revenue tracker, and the custom meta page list system that no competing tool has replicated available anywhere in the eCommerce research market today.

At 30% off, the monthly cost of accessing one of the most data-accurate and feature-complete ad intelligence platforms in the industry drops to a level where the subscription pays for itself with a single winning product identified — leaving users free to focus entirely on product research, competitive analysis, and scaling the campaigns that Afterlib's intelligence makes it possible to build with genuine data-backed confidence.
